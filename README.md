# Morphological Erosion and Dilation in Image Processing

This project was developed for my course **Integrated Systems** and focuses on the morphological operations 
of **Erosion** and **Dilation** in binary images. It is implemented in C using manual loop-level optimization techniques 
and simulated with the **ARM eXtended Debugger (AXD)**. The goal is to minimize execution cycles through algorithmic and architectural refinements.

## Project Tasks Overview
### Task 1: Erosion & Dilation Algorithm Implementation
**Erosion:**

- A 2x2 structuring element is slid over the image.

- If **all** pixels under the structuring element are 1 (or 255), the output pixel becomes 1; else, 0.

**Dilation:**

- If **at least one** pixel under the element is 1 (or 255), the output pixel becomes 1; else, 0.

### Optimization Applied
**1. External Padding Optimization**
- Moved the boundary checks outside the main erosion/dilation loops by explicitly padding the input.
- Reduced if conditions per pixel => lowered instruction count and total cycles.

**2. Loop Interchange**
- Changed access pattern from row-major to column-major.
- However, since C uses row-major storage, this increased non-sequential accesses and total cycles.

**3. Loop Fusion**
- Combined multiple for loops into single iterations in padding routines.
- Result: Reduced instruction count and slightly improved total cycles.

**4. Loop Unrolling**
- Unrolled the i loop in erosion/dilation by a step of 2 (i += 2).
- Reduced branch and compare instructions => fewer iterations.
- Tried larger steps but saw diminishing returns due to code bloat.

ðŸ”„ **Final Combination**
- Used both Loop Unrolling and Fusion for optimal performance.

âœ… Task 2: Hierarchy of Memory

- Initially assumed ideal memory: 1 cycle for reads/writes.
- Introduced realistic memory hierarchy via memory.map file.
